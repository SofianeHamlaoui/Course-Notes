Needless to say that IoT application development is touching the new height. Taking over the world at a drastic rate, transforming the way we used to look at everything before, Internet of Things is turning into a fundamental element of our lives. From your smart watch to smart home, smart trains to smart cars – Everything you have experienced before is now getting a complete smart makeover. Below are some popular and intriguing uses of Internet of Things:

1. Smart Home: Now your home can be voice-activated and sensor-activated. All you have to do is speak or move around a device to switch on the lights or remove the curtains.

2. Wearables: Smart watches are the most commonly used IoT devices. Now from attending calls to making calls, checking up all the notifications to keeping track of your heart rate – all possible with just a smart watch around your wrist.

3. Smart City: This spans a wide range of use cases including traffic management to water distributions to urban security to environmental monitoring and everything else that is key to mankind and its habitat.

4. Connected car: Although connected car is still becoming a thing in the modern age, but the future is ardently looking forward to welcoming it.


Another beautiful example of use cases in IoT can be considered as the offender monitoring using a wearable anklet. This concept was shown in the Marvel’s movie- Ant Man & The Wasp in 2018, however Hughes Systique worked with a leading IoT platform & app developer to build this use case.

The prime ask was to make sure that inmates on parole abide by the court’s law and stay away from any felony. The anklet is a GPS based tracking device which is securely tied by state officials on the inmates. Once they are on parole for a stipulated time frame, their positions can be monitored over a dashboard screen and send alerts to officials in case of any violation like moving outside the state premises/ presence in a crime scene.
